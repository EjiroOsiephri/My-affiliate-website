            Mr. A owns a company and offers several useful products for
            consumers. Mr. A offers to pay certain commissions to anyone who
            sells his product and Mr. B accepts to do this. Mr. B is an
            Affiliate. You can sign up as an Affiliate on Expernaire

            Let me simplify it a bit. A friend of yours (let me say for example)
            bola wants to buy a phone and you know another friend Ade that sells
            gadgets. then you tell bola that you know A guy named Ade and he
            sells phones , then Bola bought the phone from Ade , what just
            happened is known as Affiliate marketing. You just performed
            affiliate marketing the only difference is that you were not giving
            a commision from bringing a buyer named Bola.

        <h2>There are two types of Affiliate marketing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical Marketing</li>
          <li>Digital Marketing</li>
        </ul>
        <div className="digital-market">
          <h2>
            In the example i gave earlier that is known as Physical Affilite
            marketing. But in this discourse , we would be talking about Digital
            marketing and what exactly is it, How do i get the Products?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Digital products are online products that are like books , courses
            and the so on, things cannot touch. Now to answer the question how
            do i get this product, apps like stakecut, digistem, sellar provide
            products for you to sell and get commisions on your sale , they are
            free you don't need to pay for registration
          </h3>
        </div>
        <img src={Shots} alt="" />
        <h2>
          As you can see in the picture above this are examples of products you
          can sell, and you also see a commision , that is the amount that you
          get paid from selling the product. For the UAMP the product is $50 and
          you get 50% commision, that is 25 dollars for each sale you make. they
          are many products you can promote on the site, all cannot be explained
          on this site. So therefore i am recommending the best affiliate
          marketing course that talks about everything about affiliate marketing
          and even more.
