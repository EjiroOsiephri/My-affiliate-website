            Let me simplify it a bit. A friend of yours (let me say for example)
            bola wants to buy a phone and you know another friend Ade that sells
            gadgets. then you tell bola that you know A guy named Ade and he
            sells phones , then Bola bought the phone from Ade , what just
            happened is known as Affiliate marketing. You just performed
            affiliate marketing the only difference is that you were not giving
            a commision from bringing a buyer named Bola.
