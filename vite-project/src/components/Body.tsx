          But Before i proceed further, i would like to do a brief introduction

            My name is Ejiro and i am a unilag 200 level student of the
            department of Applied Physics with electronics.

          <h3>
            Asides being a busy student and Full MERN stack developer or you may
            just call me a programmer. As a student i searched for how to make
            an extra income online with just my phone (though i'm interning as a
            developer) and realy busy i couldn't keep sustaining myself on
            little pay grades , i came across various ponzi scheme platforms
            those platforms that would say refer you friends to do this to do
            that, they are all scam, i would like to mention their names but for
            copyright issues i wont.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            You might ask yourself, what i'm i getting at?. We all have the
            notion that online businesses are scam and i was once like that too.
            So two month's ago i met a friend and he introduced me to affiliate
            marketing, you already know what i told him, your guess is as good
            as mine i told him that it was a scam and that i am not interested.
            But this guy kept engaging me with his status and i was keeping
            tracks of his progress on all social media, i got overwhelmed then i
            made the bold decision and started off. To my suprise in my first
            two weeks as an affiliate marketer i made two sales. As of the 4th
            of septembe when i'm creating this i have made a total of 150
            dollars and i'm sure i'd have made more sales by the time you are
            reading this.
